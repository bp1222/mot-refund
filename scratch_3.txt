You are a principal software engineer at a company that is responsible for the refunding of MOT (a fuel excise tax for aircraft).

I want you to create a plan to:

You are charge of the development of a new system to handle the refunding of MOT. The system will be used by both internal staff and external customers.
The system will need to handle the following requirements:
- Tracking of aircraft
 - Each aircraft will have a unique identifier, tail number, make, model, and year of manufacture,
 - Each aircraft will have a history of owners, registration documents, airworthiness documents, insurance documents.
 - Each aircraft will have a history of management companies that manage the use of the aircraft
 - Each aircraft will have a history of clients who are engaged with a management company to use the aircraft

- Owners will have a unique identifier, name, contact information, and a history of aircraft they have owned.

- Management Companies will have a unique identifier, name, contact information, and a history of aircraft they manage and clients they serve.

The core business is to accurately track the fuel receipts for individual flights of an aircraft, to track the MOT of the fuel
uplifted onto the aircraft.

We will have a reporting system which will be able to filter based on aircraft, owner, management company, and client over a period of time,
  to be able to determine the amount of MOT to be refunded.

We will support authentication for different levels of users: administrator, data-entry, and viewer.  The data-entry user
will be able to insert new records of flights, with receipts, and be able to lookup and insert data for aircraft, owners, management companies, and client.

The system will eventually need persisted data storage, but for this prototype implementation we should use browser local storage.
  This system will need seed data, and a button in the menubar to reset the storage to the seed data.

The system should have a dashboard, one key component is calling action to tracked aircraft that have missing certificate data, or existing
  certificate data is close to expiring.  Aircraft are required to have valid registration, airworthiness, and insurance documents for periods
  of time we have flight data.

We will want to use React, Zustand, and Material UI.
